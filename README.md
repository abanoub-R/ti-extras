# TI Extras
"Extra" notes and scripts to help with algebra/trigonometry intended to be stored directly on the calculator

## Calculator Requirements
- Connect CE compatible
- Python compatible
- >28 MB Available ROM

> **_NOTE:_** These scripts were tested with the TI84 Plus CE Python Edition, other calculators are untestedi

## Anatomy
- algebra
    - more arithmatic and formula based
- shapes
    - more trigonometry / geometry based
- notes
    - things that could not be directly ported

## Installation
Coming soon

# What's next?
If I still continue to work on it, i'll probably fully implement all of notes and try to make a TI-BASIC fork to be more compatible
